# Synthetic-Data-Generation


The aim of this project is to predict fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models. This is crucial for both banks and customers as fraudulent transactions can lead to significant financial losses. Banks need effective fraud detection systems to protect their customers and their own financial interests.

## Dataset

The dataset contains transactions made over a period of two days in September 2013 by European credit cardholders. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with the positive class (frauds) accounting for only 0.172% of all transactions. Addressing this imbalance is a key challenge in building an effective fraud detection model.

## Project Goals

- **Predict fraudulent transactions:** Develop models to accurately identify fraudulent credit card transactions.
- **Address data imbalance:** Implement techniques to handle the highly imbalanced nature of the dataset.
- **Evaluate model performance:** Compare various machine learning algorithms to determine the best performing model.
